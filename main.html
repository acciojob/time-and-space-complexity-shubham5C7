	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how the run time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. 
        An algorithm with low time complexity is considered more efficient because it can handle larger inputs faster.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to execute and store its data structures. 
        For example, an algorithm that requires storing all input elements might use O(n) extra memory.
